Enhances AWS infrastructure by establishing a robust and scalable RDS database environment.  
This prioritizes minimizing Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)  
through advanced database management strategies and best practices including Multi AZ deployments of RDS and provisioning the Read Replica. 
I create a highly available RDS database, ensuring data integrity and reliability and an EC2 instance to connect to the RDS database. 
SQL clients are provisioned inside the EC2 Instance for database access and management. 
Security groups are configured to restrict direct access to the RDS instance, allowing only the designated EC2 instance to connect. 
Thorough testing, including the creation of testing tables and other essential configurations is conducted to ensure the proper functioning of the database. 
The followed tasks commit to enhancing data resilience and aligning standard needs for robust databaseÂ solutions.
